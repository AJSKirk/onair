# On Air Sign

I'm trying to build an ESP8266 powered LED light in an old school radio recording booth "On Air" sign. The idea is to hook it up to various APIs to automatically indicate if I'm on a call, so others in the house know not to barge into the room.

`esp8266/` code contains Arduino C code for running on the embedded devices, `python/` contains code for prototyping API creds and calls.
